# academy-source-control-template
For use during the practical [Source Control module](https://github.com/infinityworks/academy-curriculum/tree/main/source-control) exercises for academies.

If running the [Source Control module](https://github.com/infinityworks/academy-curriculum/tree/main/source-control), you will need to create a new repository by hitting the `Use this template` button. Give the new repository a name that makes it easy to identify who it's for. Delete the repository when you're done.

When you have created your new repository, you will need to add the learner accounts to it.

Most features have been turned off, such as Project, Issues etc. You can't push directly to `main` either. This is to encourage the learners to make use of PRs in the module exercises and also prevents any mishaps from happening.
